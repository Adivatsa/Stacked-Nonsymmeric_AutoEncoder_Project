# Stacked-Nonsymmeric_AutoEncoder_Project

A  deep  learning  approach  for network intrusion detection to improve attack detection with the help of Auto-Encoder (NDAE-IDS). Due to an increased number of attacks and network traffic, the crafting of proficient IDS has gained  much attention.

The Auto-Encoder has been the most efficient method for feature extraction from big and high dimensional data. This is the primary reason for selecting it for this proposed  model.  This  model  consists  of  two  Auto-Encoders  in which  the output  of first  Auto-Encoder acts as input  for the  next stacked  Auto-Encoder. To train  the model  layer-wise  training mechanism  have been  used and  shallow  learning method  i.e.  random forest  has  been used  to  classify  the  events into  the attack and  normal events.
